# Daily Market Brief

Generate a daily market briefing for **{{ focus | default: "all" }}** professionals as of **{{ date | default: "today" }}**.

## CRITICAL: Efficiency Constraints

This brief must complete within **5 minutes**. Total web searches across all skills: **maximum 25**.

- Market snapshot: max 8 searches
- Geopolitical monitor: max 6 searches
- Regulatory & ops intel: max 5 searches
- Event calendar: max 6 searches
- Report assembly: 0 searches (uses only collected data)

**DO NOT** re-search for data you already have. **DO NOT** search for individual assets one at a time. Use broad queries that return summary/dashboard pages. Accept the precision available from summary pages. Mark gaps as `N/A` rather than retrying.

## Instructions

Gather data using these skills, then assemble the final YAML output:

1. **market-snapshot** — global equity indices, rates, credit spreads, commodities, FX, volatility
2. **geopolitical-monitor** — central bank actions, economic data releases, geopolitical/trade/policy developments, major corporate events
3. **regulatory-ops-intel** — SEC/CFTC/EU regulatory actions, fund admin technology news, ILPA updates, operational developments for PE CFOs
4. **event-calendar** — upcoming economic calendar, central bank meetings, earnings, conferences, IPOs, auctions

**Important — avoid cross-task duplication:**
- Central bank **actions that already happened today** → geopolitical-monitor only
- Central bank **upcoming meeting dates** → event-calendar only
- Economic data **already released today** → geopolitical-monitor only
- Economic data **scheduled for future dates** → event-calendar only
- **Regulatory news** → regulatory-ops-intel only (not geopolitical-monitor)
- **Fund admin/tech vendor news** → regulatory-ops-intel only

5. **intelligence-content** skill — use this skill's format specifications to assemble all collected data into the final YAML output files. No additional searches.

## Output: Intelligence Content YAML Files

**The YAML files are the primary deliverable.** Follow the `intelligence-content` skill format exactly.

1. Create the output directories:
   ```
   mkdir -p output/intelligence-data/{ticker,daily-brief,pulse}
   ```

2. Write **three** files:
   - **`output/intelligence-data/daily-brief/{{ date | default: "YYYY-MM-DD" }}.yaml`** — Full daily brief with all 6 standard sections
   - **`output/intelligence-data/ticker/latest.yaml`** — Ticker banner with 4-6 key data points from the brief
   - **`output/intelligence-data/pulse/{{ date | default: "YYYY-MM-DD" }}.yaml`** — Private Markets Pulse with priority signals, deep dive, LP/GP signals, and sector spotlight

3. After writing, verify all files exist and are non-empty:
   ```
   ls -la output/intelligence-data/daily-brief/*.yaml output/intelligence-data/ticker/*.yaml output/intelligence-data/pulse/*.yaml
   ```

### YAML Structure Requirements

Each article YAML (daily-brief and pulse) MUST contain:
- `title` — Full title with date
- `date` — YYYY-MM-DD format
- `author` — "Equiforte Intelligence"
- `status` — "published"
- `summary` — Under 200 chars, for homepage card
- `preview` — HTML content visible to all (ungated, first 2-3 sections)
- `full_content` — HTML content with ALL sections (gated, includes preview content plus additional sections)

The ticker YAML uses a different format — see intelligence-content skill.

### Daily Brief Standard Sections (in full_content)

1. **Market Snapshot** — rates, spreads, deal activity (HTML tables)
2. **Regulatory Watch** — new rules, deadlines, guidance
3. **Operational Intel** — fund admin, technology, vendor news
4. **Data Snapshot** — key metrics table
5. **The CFO Take** — 3 actionable items for PE CFOs today
6. **Coming This Week** — upcoming events and data releases

**Preview** includes sections 1-2 (Market Snapshot + Regulatory Watch).
**Full content** includes all 6 sections.

### Pulse Standard Sections (in full_content)

1. **Today's Priority Signals** — 🔴 Action Required, 🟡 Monitor, 🟢 Opportunity
2. **Deep Dive** — detailed analysis of one theme
3. **LP/GP Signals** — fundraising and relationship intelligence
4. **Sector Spotlight** — rotating sector analysis

**Preview** includes sections 1-2.
**Full content** includes all 4 sections.

### Ticker Banner

Distill 4-6 key data points from the brief. Each item under 80 chars with ▲/▼ direction indicators.

## Focus Area Guidance

- **all**: Full briefing across all sections with equal weight.
- **pe**: Emphasize M&A activity, leveraged loan / HY markets, sponsor-backed deal flow, PE conferences.
- **pd**: Emphasize credit spreads, leveraged loan indices, CLO markets, default rates, direct lending.
- **hf**: Emphasize volatility, flows, positioning, factor performance, cross-asset momentum.
- **ib**: Emphasize ECM/DCM issuance, M&A announced/closed, IPO pipeline, sector deal activity.

## Content Rules

- All HTML content within YAML fields. Use `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<table>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<blockquote>`.
- Facts, data, and sourced statistics only. No opinions, forecasts, or subjective interpretation.
- `N/A` for unavailable data — never fabricate.
- `full_content` MUST include all preview content plus additional gated sections.
- Positive changes: `+`, Negative: `-`, Unchanged: `Unchanged`
- Rate changes in bps. Billions: `$12.3B`, Millions: `$456.7M`.

Do NOT skip the file write step. The YAML files in `output/intelligence-data/` are the deliverable.
